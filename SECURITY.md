# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The following versions of POSIX IDS are currently being supported with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The POSIX IDS team takes security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

### Where to Report

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Please report security vulnerabilities through one of the following channels:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (Preferred)
   - Navigate to the Security tab in the repository
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Follow the template to provide details

2. **Private Disclosure**
   - Email: security@[your-domain].com
   - PGP Key: [If available, provide key fingerprint]

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

1. **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Impact**: Potential impact and attack scenarios
3. **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
4. **Affected Versions**: Which versions are affected
5. **Mitigation**: Any known workarounds or mitigations
6. **References**: Related CVEs, advisories, or documentation

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Impact Assessment**: Within 5 business days
- **Patch Development**: Based on severity:
  - Critical: Within 7 days
  - High: Within 14 days
  - Medium: Within 30 days
  - Low: Next regular release

### Disclosure Policy

- We follow responsible disclosure practices
- Security advisories will be published after patches are available
- Credit will be given to reporters (unless anonymity is requested)
- We request a 90-day disclosure embargo for critical vulnerabilities

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest stable version
2. **Secure Configuration**:
   ```bash
   # Set appropriate permissions
   chmod 700 /opt/posix-ids/bin/*.sh
   chmod 600 /opt/posix-ids/config/ids.conf
   ```
3. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Run with minimal necessary permissions
4. **Log Security**: Protect and regularly review log files
5. **Baseline Management**: Secure baseline files from tampering

### For Developers

1. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize inputs
2. **Command Injection Prevention**:
   ```bash
   # Bad
   eval "$user_input"

   # Good
   case "$user_input" in
       allowed_pattern) process_input ;;
       *) echo "Invalid input" ;;
   esac
   ```
3. **Path Traversal Protection**: Validate file paths
4. **Secure Defaults**: Use secure configuration defaults
5. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive info in errors

## Security Features

### Built-in Protections

- **File Integrity Monitoring**: Detects unauthorized file changes
- **Process Monitoring**: Identifies suspicious processes
- **Network Monitoring**: Tracks network connections
- **Log Analysis**: Automated security event detection
- **Alert System**: Real-time security notifications

### Configuration Hardening

```bash
# Example secure configuration
cat > /opt/posix-ids/config/ids.conf << 'EOF'
# Security Settings
ENABLE_FILE_MONITORING=true
ENABLE_PROCESS_MONITORING=true
ENABLE_NETWORK_MONITORING=true
ALERT_THRESHOLD=medium
LOG_LEVEL=info

# Paths (use absolute paths)
BASELINE_DIR="/opt/posix-ids/baselines"
LOG_DIR="/var/log/posix-ids"
TEMP_DIR="/tmp/posix-ids"

# Permissions
UMASK=077
SECURE_MODE=true
EOF
```

## Security Checklist

### Deployment

- [ ] Running with non-root user (where possible)
- [ ] Appropriate file permissions set
- [ ] Logs stored securely
- [ ] Baseline files protected
- [ ] Configuration validated
- [ ] Alert notifications configured
- [ ] Regular updates scheduled

### Monitoring

- [ ] File integrity checks enabled
- [ ] Process monitoring active
- [ ] Network monitoring configured
- [ ] Log rotation configured
- [ ] Alert thresholds appropriate
- [ ] Splunk integration secured

## Known Security Considerations

1. **Privilege Requirements**: Some monitoring requires elevated privileges
2. **Log Injection**: Ensure log entries are properly sanitized
3. **Race Conditions**: File operations may be subject to TOCTOU issues
4. **Resource Exhaustion**: Monitor for DoS conditions

## Security Tools Integration

### Splunk Integration

- Use encrypted communications (TLS)
- Implement proper authentication
- Restrict data access appropriately
- Regular security reviews of dashboards

### SIEM Integration

- Follow vendor security guidelines
- Use API keys securely
- Implement rate limiting
- Monitor for anomalies

## Compliance

This project aims to support compliance with:

- PCI DSS (File Integrity Monitoring)
- HIPAA (Audit Controls)
- SOC 2 (Security Monitoring)
- ISO 27001 (Information Security)
